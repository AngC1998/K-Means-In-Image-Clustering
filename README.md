_Advised by [Shane A. McQuarrie](https://github.com/shanemcq18)_

The [Directed Readings Program](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/about.html) pairs undergraduate and graduate students for a semester-long independent mathematical projects. This semester we studied certain Machine Learning concepts such as Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning, K-Nearest Neighbors, and K-Means and applied them to Pixel Quantization or Image Clustering. 

**Description of the Project**
- Directed Reading Program project in Spring 2020 with mentor Shane McQuarrie
- Developed using Python with the NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib libraries
- Developed a K-Means clustering model inspired by the Obama Poster Maker on the internet
- Model clusters pixels of an original image into groups based on the RGB and reproduces an altered image that is only colored in a specific number of specific colors 
[Result similar to the Obama Hope Poster image]
