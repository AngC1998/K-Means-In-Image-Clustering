The [Directed Readings Program](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/about.html) pairs undergraduate and graduate students for a semester-long independent mathematical projects. This semester we studied certain Machine Learning concepts such as Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning, K-Nearest Neighbors, and K-Means and applied them to Pixel Quantization or Image Clustering. 

**Description of the Project**
- We implemented a K-Means algorithm in Python to organize pixels of an original image into a specific number of groups based on the original color to create a copy of an image with that specific number of colors. 
- We programmed in Python for the project, and utilized its NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.
